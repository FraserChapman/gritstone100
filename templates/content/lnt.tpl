        <p>
            * in the Peak District this means no fires or barbecues unless in a designated
            area such as on a private campsite. Barbecues, disposable barbecues or any form of open fire and flame
            are not permitted in the open countryside anywhere in the Peak District.

            Whilst it isn't always practically possible you could consider picking up any litter you see along the way and disposing it appropriately.
            Taking an empty rubbish bag is a really good idea, there are various bins in the villages along the way and it really helps.
