            The first section of the trail takes in what the Dark Peak is famed for;
            desolate tracts of heather moorland, cottongrass covered blanket peat, and open undulating high gritstone
            edges and outcrops.
            The route from Howden Edge out to Bleaklow exemplifies the Dark Peak.

            The path will disappear even in the best conditions...
            whilst in poor conditions its traverse is probably one of the most navigationally challenging, and
            rewarding, in the Peak District.
