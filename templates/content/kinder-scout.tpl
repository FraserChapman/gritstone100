        <h3>Kinder mass trespass</h3>
        <p>
            The 1932 trespass was a coordinated act of trespass on 24 April.
            It was a coordinated protest to highlight the fact that walkers in England and Wales were denied access to
            areas of open country.

            The trespass was largely organised by Benny Rothman in retaliation to the expulsion of a group of ramblers
            from Bleaklow three weeks earlier.
            It arguably led to the passage of the National Parks legislation in 1949, and in turn to The Peak District
            being designated the first national park
            in April 1951 - followed by the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor in the same year.

            It also helped pave way for the establishment of the Pennine Way and other long-distance footpaths and
            rights
            now protected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CROW) 2000.
