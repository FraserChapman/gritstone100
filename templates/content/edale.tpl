        <h3>Edale</h3>
        <p>
            Edale is a small village at the start of the UK's first and most famous long distance walking path - the <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/">Pennine Way</a>. 
            A trail which arguably owes its creation to the mass tresspass event on <a href="/kinder-scout">Kinder Scout</a> which looms over the village.

            The village itself grew from the herdsmens' shelters or 'booths' at what are now the hamlets of Upper Booth, Barber Booth, Ollerbrook Booth and Nether Booth.
            The central 'booth' was Grindsbrook Booth - now usually called Edale Village.

            The village has two popular pubs, a cafe and local shop. The village has a railway station, which also has a great cafe, and is on one of England's most spectacular railway with links between Sheffield and
            Manchester.
