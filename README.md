# GRITSTONE 100

![gritstone100](/assets/img/icon/logo-bar-trans.png "gritstone100")

An unofficial 100 mile trail across some of the best hills, moors, tors, outcrops, and gritstone edges in the High Peak area of the Peak District National Park.

Starting in the idyllic village of Low Bradfield and ending at the majestic Chatsworth House.

The trail leads you out across remote and unforgiving Bleaklow, around iconic Kinder Scout, and down the Eastern gritstone edges that the Peak District is famous for.
